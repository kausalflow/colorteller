You have submitted your color palette.

What happens next:

- [A GitHub Actions](https://github.com/kausalflow/colorteller/actions/workflows/add_new.yml) will be triggered and collect the color palette you have submitted. The action runs every one hour so it might take some time for it to work.
- The action will automatically benchmark the color palette.
- [A new Pull Request](https://github.com/kausalflow/colorteller/pulls) will be created to append a new web page to this website. There will also be a preview of the submission in the comments of the Pull Request.
- If the color palette works, the new Pull Request will be merged and your palette will be live on the product website.
